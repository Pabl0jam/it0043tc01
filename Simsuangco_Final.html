        <p>My journey began with a fascination for technology and a curiosity for coding languages. I immersed myself in learning the fundamentals of web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my skills grew, so did my ambition to create functional and visually appealing websites. Recognizing the inseparable link between web development and cybersecurity, I expanded my expertise into cybersecurity. I delved into network security, encryption technologies, and vulnerability assessments to ensure the safety and integrity of digital platforms.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h6>I designed and developed a responsive website for a non-profit organization, emphasizing accessibility and user engagement. This project involved collaborating closely with stakeholders to understand their mission and goals, integrating donation functionalities securely, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
            Also, I spearheaded a cybersecurity awareness initiative aimed at educating employees within an organization about best practices and potential threats. This project involved developing interactive training modules, conducting simulated phishing exercises, and fostering a culture of vigilance against cyber attacks.
